🫁 Pneumonia Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting Pneumonia from chest X-ray images using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by classifying X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia, which can support medical professionals in decision-making.

📌 Project Overview

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that requires timely diagnosis. Manual examination of chest X-rays can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project uses computer vision and neural networks to automate pneumonia detection with high accuracy.

🚀 Features

Binary classification: Normal vs Pneumonia

Image preprocessing and augmentation

Trained deep learning model for prediction

Evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

Easy-to-run notebook / script

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

OpenCV

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset

Chest X-ray images dataset

Images categorized into:

Normal

Pneumonia

Dataset is preprocessed (resizing, normalization) before training

Note: Dataset can be obtained from publicly available medical imaging sources such as Kaggle.

🏗️ Model Architecture

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Multiple convolution and pooling layers

Fully connected dense layers

Softmax / Sigmoid activation for classification

📊 Results

Achieved strong performance on validation data

Model effectively distinguishes between normal and pneumonia-infected lungs


📌 Future Improvements

Use transfer learning (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet)

Improve accuracy with hyperparameter tuning

Add multi-class classification for other lung diseases
